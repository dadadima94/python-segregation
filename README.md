# Python Segregation

## Description
This project simulates a segregation experiment. The code is written in Python.
Given a 100x100 grid filled non-uniformly and not entirely with two types of agents, relocate the agents based on their happiness, which is given by the number of same-type neighbours. Two different function: relocate **all** unhappy agents every iteration or relocate **one** unhappy agent every iteration.
The results are showed in the form of a heat-map of the grid and the distribution of happiness before and after the relocation.

## Requirements
* matplotlib==2.0.0
* networkx==1.11
* numpy==1.12.0
* seaborn==0.7.1


## Results
The following pictures show the grid in the form of a heat-map, before and after the relocation:
